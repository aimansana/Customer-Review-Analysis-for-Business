Marathahalli,Sudip Kumar Patel,"It is one of the best places for Hyderabadi biryani in Bangalore.  They taste was just awesome ðŸ‘Œ as expected.  We tried 2/3 types of biryani and a chicken starter , and the best taste was the Meghna special biryani. The price was  slightly on the higher side . Parking is also very limited . Service was good.",4,05-04-2025,1
Marathahalli,Tamilselvan Amirthalingam,"Meghana Foods Marathahalli has always been my go-to spot for biryani in Bengaluruâ€”we usually visit twice a month. But todayâ€™s experience was quite disappointing.<br><br>We ordered Meghana Special Boneless Biryani, which is usually flavorful, but today it lacked the usual spice and punch. The Prawn Ghee Roast was very dry and hard, making it unpleasant to eat. Meghana Chicken 555, another favorite, didnâ€™t live up to its name either. Only the Lemon Chicken was somewhat okay.",2,09-07-2025,
Marathahalli,Akhil Anilkumar,"As a Keralite, I felt the taste of Meghna Biryani was only average.  I felt the price of Rs 375 for a chicken biryani was too high.  Even though the quantity was more than expected, the popularity resulted in a very long wait time, especially at noon. We waited over 20 minutes even at 3:30 PM; imagine the wait from 12 PM to 2 PM.<br><br>The atmosphere and service were quite good. There are three floors, but every seat was occupied up to the third floor.  There is limited parking space.",3,02-05-2025,
Marathahalli,Tenzin Dhekyong,I have been always ordering food from here and eating in this restaurant for first time ..boneless chicken briyani is so good as always ..quantity is more and two people can share. Raitha ainâ€™t good like Nagarjuna ..ambience is okay,3,18-07-2025,
Marathahalli,Pooja Raibagi,"Without a doubt, Meghana Foods' biryani is one of my absolute favorites.<br>Whenever I visit Bangalore, I make sure to try their food â€” it's consistently exceptional and absolutely deliciousðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹",5,10-07-2025,
Marathahalli,PAPPALA KARTHIK,"Meghana Biryani is one of the most popular places in Bangalore for biryani, and it definitely lives up to its name. The biryani is flavorful, with the right balance of spices, and the portion sizes are generous. The place is usually crowded, which shows how much people love it, but that also means you might have to wait a bit for a table. If you enjoy spicy and authentic Andhra-style biryani, this is a must-try.",5,28-08-2025,
Marathahalli,Shweta Choudhary,"Extremely disappointed with my recent order from Meghna Foods.<br><br>I had ordered 4 plates of biryani, out of which 3 were Potato Biryani, and shockingly, the potatoes in all 3 plates were mostly raw â€” around 80% were completely uncooked.<br><br>Itâ€™s unacceptable that such a basic and main ingredient was not cooked properly. This ruined the entire meal and reflects very poorly on the quality control and standards of the kitchen.<br><br>I expected much better from Meghna Foods. I am requesting a full refund for the 3 plates of Potato Biryani and hope this issue is taken seriously.",1,20-06-2025,
Marathahalli,Ashutosh Kaushik,"I am rating 1 star so that this comes in light of the Marathahalli Meghana Foods Branch. The food is delicious there is no doubt, the service is fast and good. But what about ambience? The walls need renovation guys it looks so bad that it cant be explained in words photos attached for your reference",1,05-05-2025,
Marathahalli,anupama singh,Meghna's Mushroom Biryani is also great. And Lassi is fulfilling. If you sit on 2nd and 3rd floor it's much more comfortable during summer.,5,27-04-2025,1
Marathahalli,Rakesh Manchali,"If you're looking for an exceptional dining experience, this place nails it with its delicious biryani, great atmosphere, and fast service. The biryani is incredibly flavorful, with perfectly cooked rice, tender meat, and a rich blend of spices that make every bite a delight. The restaurant atmosphere is warm and inviting, creating the perfect backdrop for a relaxing meal. On top of that, the service is quick and efficient, ensuring you can enjoy your meal without any unnecessary delays. Whether you're a biryani enthusiast or just looking for a great place to eat, this spot definitely hits the mark! ( I ordered chicken boneless briyani)",5,02-04-2025,
