Kanakpura,AMV,"Personally have had from other outlets, maybe twice or thrice. I’m a vegetarian so only option into Biryani is the Paneer Variant. We ordered the Paneer ghee roast & Paneer Biryani.

Koramangala,alexjoyluke,"Exceptional Service and Great Food – A Truly Royal Experience at Koramangala Branch<br><br>I would rate their service 6 out of 5 – it was simply outstanding! I don’t recall the server’s name, but he was incredible. The attention to detail was next-level. For example, when our water bottles ran out, he replaced them instantly without us even asking. Despite being busy, he made sure we got our balance portions just before clearing the last scoop from the plate – that level of attentiveness is rare.<br><br>Even the person who took our order displayed excellent etiquette and hygiene. We had ordered a Coca-Cola can, and he opened it using tissue to cover his hand – a level of cleanliness and customer care I haven’t seen elsewhere.<br><br>I’ve been to their branches in Marathahalli, Indiranagar, JP Nagar, and Koramangala, and I must say Koramangala stands out for its exceptional service. The little things they do make a big difference. We genuinely felt like royalty – hats off to the team!<br><br>Food Review:<br><br>Prawns Ghee Roast – 4/5<br>Very good in taste, but I’ve had slightly better versions in Kochi and coastal areas. Still worth trying.<br><br>Mutton Dum Biryani – 4.5/5<br>Excellent flavors, tender and well-cooked mutton, soft rice – definitely a must-try!<br><br>Special Boneless Chicken Biryani – 4/5<br>As expected, very good and flavorful, but the mutton biryani still wins.<br><br>Special Lemon Chicken – 3.5/5<br>Good taste, but not exceptional.

I always prefer air conditioned rooms to dine in especially in summers, we were directed to 2nd floor.<br><br>Since it was a weekday’s , the restaurant wasn’t that crowded, infact we were the first one to arrive in AC seating area.<br><br>We were proved with menus, but we had already decided what to eat, so we chose 2 biryanis from available 4 options.<br>Paneer biryani &<br>Aloo dum biryani<br>We also ordered a sprite and a butter milk.<br><br>We got the order within few minutes.<br>First we were served with paneer biryani, no doubt this biryani being the star dish of the Meghana’s (vegetarian section),<br>The flavourful rice’s served with panee cubes which are quoted with delicious masala. Loved it.<br><br>Next we were served with aloo dum biryani, the same flavourful rice’s served with big half cut boiled aloos & spicy masala.<br><br>I prefer paneer biryani over aloo dum biryani for sure.<br><br>While my friends are, I checked the other floors and washroom. The restaurant is really well maintained, good number of seating arrangements for the customer.

Koramangala,Jaber M.,"Meghana Foods is a good, no-frills restaurant. One thing that stands out right away is the hygiene. All the staff wear hair nets, which gives a lot of confidence that they take cleanliness seriously. It also explains their popularity, both in terms of the number of Google reviews and how busy the place gets.<br><br>I tried the Chicken Biryani and the Pepper Chicken Fry. The biryani was not really my style, but to be fair, it is because they serve the Andhra style, which is not my preference. They do have Hyderabadi biryani as well, for those who like that. On the other hand, the Pepper Chicken Fry was excellent. I finished it in no time, it was full of flavour and cooked just right.<br><br>The staff are very friendly and maybe a bit too attentive at times, but it adds to the overall positive experience. Both dishes were quite spicy, and I felt like cooling down with a cup of chai or filter coffee, but unfortunately, they only serve cold drinks.<br><br>Overall, it is a solid choice if you want straightforward food with good hygiene standards and welcoming service.",3,13/04/2025,"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90A8DCWou7PjXt7vipKpFkqTsSO7zEoHb1HykiwE2Hf5iezrnzbnF1xwSbfFE_vYoeb1O6uiI_2bMCWAbqdq0S5F3tyVVAR5eQt9aZLNtqUrj2Pmceqdzrt4tvjaXCEMdYzmZTulCA

Koramangala,saish gaonkar,"Meghana Foods in Koramangala is well-known for its unique biryani presentation, where the flavorful masala (chicken or paneer) is layered on top of the rice. While their chicken biryani is undeniably delicious, the price point makes it a less accessible option for regular biryani cravings. The portion size is certainly adequate. Be prepared for crowds, especially on weekends and holidays during peak hours, as you'll likely encounter a wait.  On a separate occasion, I tried the Chicken 65, which was decent but nothing particularly memorable.  Overall, Meghana Foods offers a tasty biryani experience, but the pricing and potential wait times are factors to consider.",4,21/02/2025,"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BZtI5_cILpBxdGGbL3ZzMOUsx7TAQGVuT6P6F4h0B1iZrPfFxPCp8yd8xmEaCHJhNYl42iWOBbthJQJNUDmD-E1X1U7PeMnZgx79LPzaf0iNfa0z2GPxjwRh5Lklz4yJDun95vow

Koramangala,alexjoyluke,"Exceptional Service and Great Food – A Truly Royal Experience at Koramangala Branch<br><br>I would rate their service 6 out of 5 – it was simply outstanding! I don’t recall the server’s name, but he was incredible. The attention to detail was next-level. For example, when our water bottles ran out, he replaced them instantly without us even asking. Despite being busy, he made sure we got our balance portions just before clearing the last scoop from the plate – that level of attentiveness is rare.<br><br>Even the person who took our order displayed excellent etiquette and hygiene. We had ordered a Coca-Cola can, and he opened it using tissue to cover his hand – a level of cleanliness and customer care I haven’t seen elsewhere.<br><br>I’ve been to their branches in Marathahalli, Indiranagar, JP Nagar, and Koramangala, and I must say Koramangala stands out for its exceptional service. The little things they do make a big difference. We genuinely felt like royalty – hats off to the team!<br><br>Food Review:<br><br>Prawns Ghee Roast – 4/5<br>Very good in taste, but I’ve had slightly better versions in Kochi and coastal areas. Still worth trying.<br><br>Mutton Dum Biryani – 4.5/5<br>Excellent flavors, tender and well-cooked mutton, soft rice – definitely a must-try!<br><br>Special Boneless Chicken Biryani – 4/5<br>As expected, very good and flavorful, but the mutton biryani still wins.<br><br>Special Lemon Chicken – 3.5/5<br>Good taste, but not exceptional. Personally, I prefer their regular Lemon Chicken, which is outstanding.",5,10/08/2025,"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BV6ywsKs97UOsmGzeE0E2cLGoS4nNb3cIXY8vnzKZQlR6lGi-vHtdle_CppNdwz4LzXyef0LZ3cFsDxEz4AlVRpYL6jX06b3-YDX6IqmBGBc1h_e5uTZ_4FRNsk6M4gp8SRkwP6FAgQBec

Koramangala,chetan desai,"Ever since I moved to Namma Bengaluru to live my life, the name Meghana has always been associated with the biryani. It’s like they are synonyms.<br><br>Despite of being pure vegetarians, I and my friend often visit Meghana’s to enjoy their vegetarian biriyanis ( some of the people argue that there’s nothing called vegetarian biryani, it’s just pulav, I don’t care, they have got it on their menu).<br><br>Visited this Koramangala branch of this franchise for our Thursday lunch. I always prefer air conditioned rooms to dine in especially in summers, we were directed to 2nd floor.<br><br>Since it was a weekday’s , the restaurant wasn’t that crowded, infact we were the first one to arrive in AC seating area.<br><br>We were proved with menus, but we had already decided what to eat, so we chose 2 biryanis from available 4 options.<br>Paneer biryani &<br>Aloo dum biryani<br>We also ordered a sprite and a butter milk.<br><br>We got the order within few minutes.<br>First we were served with paneer biryani, no doubt this biryani being the star dish of the Meghana’s (vegetarian section),<br>The flavourful rice’s served with panee cubes which are quoted with delicious masala. Loved it.<br><br>Next we were served with aloo dum biryani, the same flavourful rice’s served with big half cut boiled aloos & spicy masala.<br><br>I prefer paneer biryani over aloo dum biryani for sure.<br><br>While my friends are, I checked the other floors and washroom.

Koramangala,Jaber M.,"Meghana Foods is a good, no-frills restaurant. One thing that stands out right away is the hygiene. All the staff wear hair nets, which gives a lot of confidence that they take cleanliness seriously. It also explains their popularity, both in terms of the number of Google reviews and how busy the place gets.<br><br>I tried the Chicken Biryani and the Pepper Chicken Fry. The biryani was not really my style, but to be fair, it is because they serve the Andhra style, which is not my preference. They do have Hyderabadi biryani as well, for those who like that. On the other hand, the Pepper Chicken Fry was excellent. I finished it in no time, it was full of flavour and cooked just right.<br><br>The staff are very friendly and maybe a bit too attentive at times, but it adds to the overall positive experience. Both dishes were quite spicy, and I felt like cooling down with a cup of chai or filter coffee, but unfortunately, they only serve cold drinks.<br><br>Overall, it is a solid choice if you want straightforward food with good hygiene standards and welcoming service.",3,13/04/2025,"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90A8DCWou7PjXt7vipKpFkqTsSO7zEoHb1HykiwE2Hf5iezrnzbnF1xwSbfFE_vYoeb1O6uiI_2bMCWAbqdq0S5F3tyVVAR5eQt9aZLNtqUrj2Pmceqdzrt4tvjaXCEMdYzmZTulCA

Koramangala,saish gaonkar,"Meghana Foods in Koramangala is well-known for its unique biryani presentation, where the flavorful masala (chicken or paneer) is layered on top of the rice. While their chicken biryani is undeniably delicious, the price point makes it a less accessible option for regular biryani cravings. The portion size is certainly adequate. Be prepared for crowds, especially on weekends and holidays during peak hours, as you'll likely encounter a wait.  On a separate occasion, I tried the Chicken 65, which was decent but nothing particularly memorable.

Sarjapur,nidhin sugunan,"Ordered biryani from here for a Sunday brunch, but it turned out to be quite “mid.” I tried the Boneless Chicken Biryani, Meghana Special Biryani, and Chicken Biryani.<br><br>On the positive side, the packaging was neat, the quality was good, and the quantity was just right. The chicken pieces were tender, and the rice was flavorful. However, the downsides made it difficult to fully enjoy the meal. The masala in the Boneless Chicken Biryani was overly salty, while the Meghana Special had an overpowering eggy flavor in the masala, which was quite off-putting.<br><br>For a biryani that costs close to 400, I expected better.

Sarjapur,Ramesh Nonia,"I've been a long-time fan of Meghana Foods and especially loved their Paneer Biryani. However, lately, the quality has noticeably declined. The biryani doesn’t taste as good as it used to, and the paneer has become tough and difficult to chew. It's disappointing to see such a beloved place lose its consistency.<br><br>Meghana Foods needs to take this feedback seriously and make efforts to improve the food quality again.

Sarjapur,nidhin sugunan,"Ordered biryani from here for a Sunday brunch, but it turned out to be quite “mid.” I tried the Boneless Chicken Biryani, Meghana Special Biryani, and Chicken Biryani.<br><br>On the positive side, the packaging was neat, the quality was good, and the quantity was just right. The chicken pieces were tender, and the rice was flavorful. However, the downsides made it difficult to fully enjoy the meal. The masala in the Boneless Chicken Biryani was overly salty, while the Meghana Special had an overpowering eggy flavor in the masala, which was quite off-putting.<br><br>For a biryani that costs close to 400, I expected better.

Singasandra,spoorthy devaiah,"To dine at Meghana Foods is an experience in itself. We had 10 mins of waiting line before we were led to a seat of 4 although we were 2 of us. Because of the queue, we thought they will make us dine with 2 other strangers in the same table but it wasn’t the case. We ordered Gobi 65 and it tasted really really good with mild flavours and no synthetic color whatsoever. Then arrived our boneless chicken biryani which was the star of the show.

Ashok Nagar,Gaurav Bhatt,"The food was reliably good, as always. We ordered Biryani, Chicken, and Butter Naan. The Biryani maintained its usual quality, the chicken was tasty, but the naan was paper thin.

It took five minutes to get mint chutney after our initial request, despite our food being served ten minutes earlier. Additionally, we requested two glasses for a half bottle of Coke, but our request was ignored initially.

The pieces are coated in batter and fried and then put as a gravy on top of the pile of biriyani rice. Very bad. Probably when you order normal biryani it comes with bone and there probably it's not put in a batter and fried.<br>3. It's so sad that chicken 65 is recommended but its not chicken 65 at all. The original is the one from Buhari hotel in Chennai and which is deep fried and red in colour and no batter. This one is again batter and not oil fried but cooked or something.

Ashok Nagar,Gaurav Bhatt,"The food was reliably good, as always. We ordered Biryani, Chicken, and Butter Naan. The Biryani maintained its usual quality, the chicken was tasty, but the naan was paper thin. It would be better if the naan was more layered and slightly thicker.<br>Unfortunately, the service did not match the standard of the food. It took five minutes to get mint chutney after our initial request, despite our food being served ten minutes earlier. Additionally, we requested two glasses for a half bottle of Coke, but our request was ignored initially. After reminding the staff, one went to the manager but never returned, leaving us waiting fifteen minutes before another waiter finally provided the glasses.

Ashok Nagar,Sanjeev M,Advice:<br><br>1. Just take 1 biriyani if 2 people are going<br>2. Never order boneless chicken biriyani. The pieces are coated in batter and fried and then put as a gravy on top of the pile of biriyani rice. Very bad. Probably when you order normal biryani it comes with bone and there probably it's not put in a batter and fried.<br>3. It's so sad that chicken 65 is recommended but its not chicken 65 at all. The original is the one from Buhari hotel in Chennai and which is deep fried and red in colour and no batter. This one is again batter and not oil fried but cooked or something.

Jayanagar,Chintan Mandagadde Nagappagowda,"I’ve been a regular customer at Meghana Biryani, both at the Jayanagar 4th Block outlet and also in Koramangala. I usually come here for their Boneless Chicken Biryani – and I must say, the taste never disappoints. The biryani is rich in flavor, aromatic, and truly one of the best in Bengaluru. Ambience is also nice and welcoming, which makes it a good place for food lovers, especially those coming from different parts of India.<br><br>However, I’ve noticed something that I feel needs to be addressed. As a Kannadiga, I’ve often felt that the staff doesn’t treat local customers with the same warmth or respect as they do with North Indian visitors. It seems like the focus is more on those who tip well or speak in Hindi, and that really left me disappointed. We locals also come to enjoy good food and deserve to be treated with equal courtesy.<br><br>Also, while the food is undoubtedly good, the prices are quite high – not very budget-friendly for regular visits.

Jayanagar,Chintan Mandagadde Nagappagowda,"I’ve been a regular customer at Meghana Biryani, both at the Jayanagar 4th Block outlet and also in Koramangala. I usually come here for their Boneless Chicken Biryani – and I must say, the taste never disappoints. The biryani is rich in flavor, aromatic, and truly one of the best in Bengaluru. Ambience is also nice and welcoming, which makes it a good place for food lovers, especially those coming from different parts of India.<br><br>However, I’ve noticed something that I feel needs to be addressed. As a Kannadiga, I’ve often felt that the staff doesn’t treat local customers with the same warmth or respect as they do with North Indian visitors. It seems like the focus is more on those who tip well or speak in Hindi, and that really left me disappointed. We locals also come to enjoy good food and deserve to be treated with equal courtesy.<br><br>Also, while the food is undoubtedly good, the prices are quite high – not very budget-friendly for regular visits. A bit more value-for-money would make the experience much better.<br><br>Great food, but hoping the management improves in terms of service attitude and pricing.",3,23/04/2025,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90DDfaQ6FNhDvMOrdSiY6emHwxMSWXpNfOpt8xUQgbkTS8xJdRuAZ_t4IWuy7-TvFQBEjfUGkm7jtBbqd4hNlbSQVBc0kMFfa-npdZgUCwn5GAh2JSpSa5ShDWXceMFbwx4sKmDd,,"Dear Chintan,<br>Thank you so much for being a loyal patron of Meghana Foods and for taking the time to share such detailed feedback.
