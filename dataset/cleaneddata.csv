Kanakpura,AMV,"Personally have had from other outlets, maybe twice or thrice. I‚Äôm a vegetarian so only option into Biryani is the Paneer Variant. We ordered the Paneer ghee roast & Paneer Biryani. The ghee roast‚Äôs paneer was not upto the mark, the paneer didn‚Äôt seem fresh. The rice of the biryani was unusually too dry.<br><br>We were happy there is a new outlet, now so nearby, but the quality seemed compromised!<br>Please improve.",3,23/08/2025,

Kanakpura,anupam 013,I have ordered meghana special chicken biryani but taste was not at all good. As I love meghana biryani a lot but after having biryani from here I thought not to order again.,1,23/08/2025,
Kanakpura,Soumya Tripathy,Meghna special Biryani rice was not good. My family members felt sick after having it yesterday.<br><br>Somehow this outlet doesn‚Äôt have the charm of Meghna foods.  taste and quality is not on par. Now I‚Äôm thinking to avoid Meghna foods.,1,25/08/2025,
Kanakpura,Sridhar Siri,"I just took 2 biryani and chicken parcel, biryani was too tangy... Not at all good to eat.",2,10/08/2025,
Kanakpura,Yugi P,"I had high expectations from Meghana Biryani, but honestly, the taste was very disappointing. The biryani lacked authentic flavor ‚Äì it felt bland rather than rich and balanced. The spices didn‚Äôt blend well,. For the price, I expected much better quality and taste. Overall, it did not meet and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.",1,18/08/2025,
Kanakpura,Vikram,"I took box meghanas special biryani and tbh I quantity of chicken pieces is very less for the price. Instead of giving so much raita and gravy, add extra pcs of chicken. This portion is very good for one person serving but little on a expensive side.",3,19/08/2025,

Koramangala,alexjoyluke,"Exceptional Service and Great Food ‚Äì A Truly Royal Experience at Koramangala Branch<br><br>I would rate their service 6 out of 5 ‚Äì it was simply outstanding! I don‚Äôt recall the server‚Äôs name, but he was incredible. The attention to detail was next-level. For example, when our water bottles ran out, he replaced them instantly without us even asking. Despite being busy, he made sure we got our balance portions just before clearing the last scoop from the plate ‚Äì that level of attentiveness is rare.<br><br>Even the person who took our order displayed excellent etiquette and hygiene. We had ordered a Coca-Cola can, and he opened it using tissue to cover his hand ‚Äì a level of cleanliness and customer care I haven‚Äôt seen elsewhere.<br><br>I‚Äôve been to their branches in Marathahalli, Indiranagar, JP Nagar, and Koramangala, and I must say Koramangala stands out for its exceptional service. The little things they do make a big difference. We genuinely felt like royalty ‚Äì hats off to the team!<br><br>Food Review:<br><br>Prawns Ghee Roast ‚Äì 4/5<br>Very good in taste, but I‚Äôve had slightly better versions in Kochi and coastal areas. Still worth trying.<br><br>Mutton Dum Biryani ‚Äì 4.5/5<br>Excellent flavors, tender and well-cooked mutton, soft rice ‚Äì definitely a must-try!<br><br>Special Boneless Chicken Biryani ‚Äì 4/5<br>As expected, very good and flavorful, but the mutton biryani still wins.<br><br>Special Lemon Chicken ‚Äì 3.5/5<br>Good taste, but not exceptional. Personally, I prefer their regular Lemon Chicken, which is outstanding.",5,10/08/2025,1.0
Koramangala,chetan desai,"Ever since I moved to Namma Bengaluru to live my life, the name Meghana has always been associated with the biryani. It‚Äôs like they are synonyms.<br><br>Despite of being pure vegetarians, I and my friend often visit Meghana‚Äôs to enjoy their vegetarian biriyanis ( some of the people argue that there‚Äôs nothing called vegetarian biryani, it‚Äôs just pulav, I don‚Äôt care, they have got it on their menu).<br><br>Visited this Koramangala branch of this franchise for our Thursday lunch. I always prefer air conditioned rooms to dine in especially in summers, we were directed to 2nd floor.<br><br>Since it was a weekday‚Äôs , the restaurant wasn‚Äôt that crowded, infact we were the first one to arrive in AC seating area.<br><br>We were proved with menus, but we had already decided what to eat, so we chose 2 biryanis from available 4 options.<br>Paneer biryani &<br>Aloo dum biryani<br>We also ordered a sprite and a butter milk.<br><br>We got the order within few minutes.<br>First we were served with paneer biryani, no doubt this biryani being the star dish of the Meghana‚Äôs (vegetarian section),<br>The flavourful rice‚Äôs served with panee cubes which are quoted with delicious masala. Loved it.<br><br>Next we were served with aloo dum biryani, the same flavourful rice‚Äôs served with big half cut boiled aloos & spicy masala.<br><br>I prefer paneer biryani over aloo dum biryani for sure.<br><br>While my friends are, I checked the other floors and washroom. The restaurant is really well maintained, good number of seating arrangements for the customer. The washroom was clean n hygienic too.<br><br>One of the best places for a budget friendly and tasty team dinners/ team lunches.",5,25/04/2025,
Koramangala,Nirmala Pajaniradja,"Flabbergasted by their service n hospitality. Cleanliness at its best. We tried their signature meghna foods chicken biriyani and loved it.

Thank you!",5,20/04/2025,
Koramangala,Chiranjeevi,"I had a great experience with Meghana Foods! I ordered their Chicken Biryani Special for takeaway and it was absolutely delicious ‚Äî full of flavor and perfectly cooked. What impressed me even more was how quickly they prepared my order I got it within just 5 minutes. The staff were also very helpful and polite, which made the whole experience even better.",5,08/04/2025,
Koramangala,Chiithuzhiio Mao,"We tried the chicken biryani and it lived up to the hype. The rice was flavorful, the chicken was well-cooked and tender, and the spice level was just right. Portions were generous for its price. The place can get busy, but the service was quick.",4,22/06/2025,1.0

Koramangala,Jaber M.,"Meghana Foods is a good, no-frills restaurant. One thing that stands out right away is the hygiene. All the staff wear hair nets, which gives a lot of confidence that they take cleanliness seriously. It also explains their popularity, both in terms of the number of Google reviews and how busy the place gets.<br><br>I tried the Chicken Biryani and the Pepper Chicken Fry. The biryani was not really my style, but to be fair, it is because they serve the Andhra style, which is not my preference. They do have Hyderabadi biryani as well, for those who like that. On the other hand, the Pepper Chicken Fry was excellent. I finished it in no time, it was full of flavour and cooked just right.<br><br>The staff are very friendly and maybe a bit too attentive at times, but it adds to the overall positive experience. Both dishes were quite spicy, and I felt like cooling down with a cup of chai or filter coffee, but unfortunately, they only serve cold drinks.<br><br>Overall, it is a solid choice if you want straightforward food with good hygiene standards and welcoming service.",3,13/04/2025,

Koramangala,saish gaonkar,"Meghana Foods in Koramangala is well-known for its unique biryani presentation, where the flavorful masala (chicken or paneer) is layered on top of the rice. While their chicken biryani is undeniably delicious, the price point makes it a less accessible option for regular biryani cravings. The portion size is certainly adequate. Be prepared for crowds, especially on weekends and holidays during peak hours, as you'll likely encounter a wait.  On a separate occasion, I tried the Chicken 65, which was decent but nothing particularly memorable.  Overall, Meghana Foods offers a tasty biryani experience, but the pricing and potential wait times are factors to consider.",4,21/02/2025,1.0
Sarjapur,Rafi,"Meghna Foods in Sarjapur is a well-loved spot for those seeking flavorful, satisfying meals at reasonable prices. Known for its rich Indian and Andhra-style cuisine, the restaurant consistently delivers bold flavors and generous portions. Their biryanis are a standout ‚Äî aromatic, perfectly spiced, and served with complementary sides like raita and salan. The Meghna Special Biryani, in particular, is a must-try for first-time visitors.<br><br>Beyond biryani, the menu offers a variety of curries, starters, and breads that cater to both vegetarian and non-vegetarian preferences. Items like their Butter Chicken, Andhra Chilli Chicken, and Guntur Chicken are particularly popular. The food is served hot and fresh, with an emphasis on authentic taste.<br><br>The ambience is simple yet comfortable, making it ideal for casual dining with family or friends. Service is usually prompt, although peak hours can lead to slight delays. The staff are courteous and attentive, ensuring a pleasant dining experience overall.<br><br>Meghna Foods also offers efficient takeaway and delivery services, which are widely appreciated in the Sarjapur area. For anyone craving hearty South Indian or spicy Andhra meals, Meghna Foods is a reliable and satisfying choice. It balances taste, quality, and value impressively well.",5,29/04/2025,1.0
Sarjapur,Manaswita Sil,"My siblings and I had Meghana Special Biryani, which was strongly recommended by one of my Kannadiga friends. It was tasty, no doubt. But the showstopper was the starter named Chicken 555. It was superb. Tangy, spicy, flavorsome! Must try! The service and ambience were perfect.",5,10/05/2025,
Sarjapur,Devesh Toshniwal,"Meghana's is the place to go for Hyderabadi Biryani in Bangalore, hands down. Their biryani is the best, period. We got the Paneer Biryani, Paneer 65, and Potato Biryani.

Sarjapur,Arava Ranjhitha,"There's free parking available downstairs. The boneless chicken biryani was delicious, and the service was exceptional (10/10). I noticed a significant wait time on weekends, so I recommend arriving early to avoid the queue.<br><br>The security staff did an excellent job managing the seating arrangements. The tables were cleaned incredibly fast, allowing for quick turnover and minimizing wait times, which was truly impressive",5,12/06/2025,
Sarjapur,Harsh RJ,This is a good outlet for Meghana Foods located on Sarjapur road. The food is the same like the other outlets.<br>The service is good and you don't have to wait a lot for the food. The good point about this place is it has a good ambience and has seating capacity is enough so you will not have to usually wait for a table to get empty and then occupy it.<br>Overall a great place in Bangalore for delicious food.,4,28/04/2025,
Sarjapur,Ramesh Nonia,"I've been a long-time fan of Meghana Foods and especially loved their Paneer Biryani. However, lately, the quality has noticeably declined. The biryani doesn‚Äôt taste as good as it used to, and the paneer has become tough and difficult to chew. It's disappointing to see such a beloved place lose its consistency.<br><br>Meghana Foods needs to take this feedback seriously and make efforts to improve the food quality again. If this continues, it could really impact their reputation and loyal customer base. I genuinely hope they bring back the same great taste and quality we once loved.",3,26/07/2025,
Sarjapur,nidhin sugunan,"Ordered biryani from here for a Sunday brunch, but it turned out to be quite ‚Äúmid.‚Äù I tried the Boneless Chicken Biryani, Meghana Special Biryani, and Chicken Biryani.<br><br>On the positive side, the packaging was neat, the quality was good, and the quantity was just right. The chicken pieces were tender, and the rice was flavorful. However, the downsides made it difficult to fully enjoy the meal. The masala in the Boneless Chicken Biryani was overly salty, while the Meghana Special had an overpowering eggy flavor in the masala, which was quite off-putting.<br><br>For a biryani that costs close to 400, I expected better. This inconsistency is exactly why I had stopped ordering from Meghana in the past. With so many great options available in Bangalore now, I find it hard to justify coming back unless they work on maintaining consistency.",3,30/03/2025,
Sarjapur,Battu Jeyavardhini,"We visited Meghana Foods last week, believe it or not, despite the prices, the food tastes so good. We ordered Chicken Fry Piece Biryani and Meghana Spl Biryani. Must try is Meghana Spl Biryani, it meets all the flavours that I ever tasted in Andhra. If you want to forget the budget for once in a week, you can visit Meghana Foods !!",4,10/05/2025,

Singasandra,Nayana J,"The dine in experience at Meghana Foods was really nice. Tried Chicken fry piece biryani, banjara chicken and Chilli guava mojito.

Singasandra,saish gaonkar,"Meghana Foods Singasandra: Must-Try Boneless Biryani & Great Service!<br>Meghana Foods in Singasandra offers the convenience of parking right in front. Be prepared for a wait during peak hours, but the welcoming service makes it worthwhile. The seating is spacious, comfy, and ample for groups. The Boneless Chicken Biryani is a definite must-try here, featuring wonderfully soft biryani rice. Portions are generous, easily enough for two light eaters. The Chicken Legs and Pepper Chicken are also good options. While the menu is a little overpriced, it's generally reasonable given the quality.",4,19/07/2025,

Singasandra,spoorthy devaiah,"To dine at Meghana Foods is an experience in itself. We had 10 mins of waiting line before we were led to a seat of 4 although we were 2 of us. Because of the queue, we thought they will make us dine with 2 other strangers in the same table but it wasn‚Äôt the case. We ordered Gobi 65 and it tasted really really good with mild flavours and no synthetic color whatsoever. Then arrived our boneless chicken biryani which was the star of the show. I felt the portion was large enough for 2 light eaters. Great experience all in all.",5,10/01/2025,
Singasandra,Neeraj Soundararajan,"I've been a loyal customer of Meghana Foods for the past 5 years, and I'm thrilled to say that I've never been disappointed with their service or quality!<br><br>While it's true that Meghana Foods is famous for its non-veg biryani options, I can confidently say that their veg biryani is equally delicious and satisfying.<br>Consistent Quality: Meghana Foods has maintained its high standards over the years, and I've never had a bad experience.<br>Moderate Pricing: Meals are reasonably priced between ‚Çπ200-‚Çπ400 per person.<br>Convenient Options: Enjoy their delicious biryani at home with delivery and takeaway options.<br>Ample Parking: No worries about parking; they have ample space available.<br>Efficient Seating: Even during crowded hours, the staff ensures a smooth seating arrangement.<br>If you're a biryani lover like me, look no further than Meghana Foods!",4,15/02/2025,

Singasandra,Faraz Ahmed,We loved the prawns Biryani and their signature chicken Biryani.. Paneer Biryani was above average as well.. Their starter chicken legs were lip smacking filled with juices and spiciness.. Their Biryani's are a bit on the spicy side especially the pieces of Biryani.. Service is top notch and Ambience is great with well lit and spacious comfy seats.. Parking available for around 6-8 cars.. We spent close to 2000 for 4 people which includes juice as well.. Enjoy your Biryani in good quality and quantity!!!,5,13/05/2025,
Singasandra,Shaktimaya Sahoo,Today I ordered Meghana special chicken biryani along with fry chicken biryani and found a feather of chicken. now I can imagine the level of hygiene you people are maintaining,1,06/08/2025,
Ashok Nagar,Jayesh Menon,"Tried the much-talked-about Meghana Special Biryani today at Meghana Foods.<br>Being a fan of Hyderabadi-style biryani, I finally decided to see what the buzz was all about. I ordered their boneless Meghana Special Chicken Biryani along with a regular sweet lassi.<br><br>Portion size? Generous is an understatement. Easily enough for two people if paired with a starter or soup. I‚Äôm someone with a big appetite, and even I found it difficult to finish.<br>The flavor was good, the chicken was tender, and the spices were well-balanced. But somewhere along the way, probably due to the sheer quantity, the excitement wore off, and the meal started to feel a bit overwhelming. Add a full glass of lassi to that, and I was definitely stuffed.<br><br>Overall, it was good but didn‚Äôt quite live up to the hype I‚Äôve often heard. Worth trying once for the experience and quantity, but personally, I wouldn‚Äôt place it as the absolute best biryani in Bangalore.",3,16/06/2025,
Ashok Nagar,Gaurav Bhatt,"The food was reliably good, as always. We ordered Biryani, Chicken, and Butter Naan. The Biryani maintained its usual quality, the chicken was tasty, but the naan was paper thin. It would be better if the naan was more layered and slightly thicker.<br>Unfortunately, the service did not match the standard of the food. It took five minutes to get mint chutney after our initial request, despite our food being served ten minutes earlier. Additionally, we requested two glasses for a half bottle of Coke, but our request was ignored initially. After reminding the staff, one went to the manager but never returned, leaving us waiting fifteen minutes before another waiter finally provided the glasses. Such neglect for a customer is disappointing.<br>I strongly urge the restaurant to address these service issues to ensure that future customers have a consistently positive experience.<br>PS: The rating 2 star is solely because of the service.",2,29/08/2025,
Ashok Nagar,Sanjeev M,Advice:<br><br>1. Just take 1 biriyani if 2 people are going<br>2. Never order boneless chicken biriyani. The pieces are coated in batter and fried and then put as a gravy on top of the pile of biriyani rice. Very bad. Probably when you order normal biryani it comes with bone and there probably it's not put in a batter and fried.<br>3. It's so sad that chicken 65 is recommended but its not chicken 65 at all. The original is the one from Buhari hotel in Chennai and which is deep fried and red in colour and no batter. This one is again batter and not oil fried but cooked or something.  Please rename it to something else.<br><br>Overall not very good. Will not go again.,2,12/07/2025,
Ashok Nagar,ronali priyadarshini,Heard so much about this place. We tried there Hyderabadi biriyani. just delicious. Quality quantity and flavours outstanding. Service is good. Visit early or you have to wait for some time.. must try.,5,18/08/2025,
Ashok Nagar,The Bruh,Went here to taste their special meghana biriyani. The b/l special biryani had ample pieces and quantity also was good . The flavour was subtle and can try once for the hype . Their special tandoori chicken was good but nothing as to be extraordinary. This hotel had large seating capacity and can accommodate more people,4,25/08/2025,
Ashok Nagar,Vidhyaa Dayanandh (Vidu),"One of the unique biryani, you will get it nowhere else.. A little spicy and good for the quick lunch coz it‚Äôs crowded. We had ordered prawn biryani , chicken and mutton biryani and few starters.",4,27/06/2025,
Ashok Nagar,Pranav Kabade,"I had the best biryani experience at Meghana‚Äôs in Bengaluru. The flavors were rich, the spices perfectly balanced, and every bite felt authentic.

Jayanagar,shaswat patra,If you are in Bangalore for a minimum of 1month then you must have heard about Meghana Biryani. The Biryani is not like Hyderabad Dum Biryani but its taste unique and tastes awesome. Tried Mutton Biryani this time and it turned out to be amazing.

Jayanagar,Chintan Mandagadde Nagappagowda,"I‚Äôve been a regular customer at Meghana Biryani, both at the Jayanagar 4th Block outlet and also in Koramangala. I usually come here for their Boneless Chicken Biryani ‚Äì and I must say, the taste never disappoints. The biryani is rich in flavor, aromatic, and truly one of the best in Bengaluru. Ambience is also nice and welcoming, which makes it a good place for food lovers, especially those coming from different parts of India.<br><br>However, I‚Äôve noticed something that I feel needs to be addressed. As a Kannadiga, I‚Äôve often felt that the staff doesn‚Äôt treat local customers with the same warmth or respect as they do with North Indian visitors. It seems like the focus is more on those who tip well or speak in Hindi, and that really left me disappointed. We locals also come to enjoy good food and deserve to be treated with equal courtesy.<br><br>Also, while the food is undoubtedly good, the prices are quite high ‚Äì not very budget-friendly for regular visits.

To my absolute shock and horror, halfway through the meal, I discovered chicken pieces mixed in with the paneer. Thankfully, I noticed the difference before swallowing it‚Äîbut the damage is already done.<br><br>This is not just a mistake; it‚Äôs a serious breach of trust, especially for someone who follows a strict vegetarian diet due to personal, ethical, or religious reasons. I am now questioning the kitchen‚Äôs hygiene, food segregation practices, and SOPs.<br><br>We pay a premium expecting safe, labelled food from a reputed brand, not to have our beliefs and preferences violated. To make things worse, no one from the restaurant has bothered to respond to my calls or messages.

Marathahalli,PAPPALA KARTHIK,"Meghana Biryani is one of the most popular places in Bangalore for biryani, and it definitely lives up to its name. The biryani is flavorful, with the right balance of spices, and the portion sizes are generous. The place is usually crowded, which shows how much people love it, but that also means you might have to wait a bit for a table. If you enjoy spicy and authentic Andhra-style biryani, this is a must-try.",5,28-08-2025,
Marathahalli,Tenzin Dhekyong,I have been always ordering food from here and eating in this restaurant for first time ..boneless chicken briyani is so good as always ..quantity is more and two people can share. Raitha ain‚Äôt good like Nagarjuna ..ambience is okay,3,18-07-2025,
Marathahalli,Pooja Raibagi,"Without a doubt, Meghana Foods' biryani is one of my absolute favorites.<br>Whenever I visit Bangalore, I make sure to try their food ‚Äî it's consistently exceptional and absolutely deliciousüòãüòã",5,10-07-2025,
Marathahalli,Tamilselvan Amirthalingam,"Meghana Foods Marathahalli has always been my go-to spot for biryani in Bengaluru‚Äîwe usually visit twice a month. But today‚Äôs experience was quite disappointing.<br><br>We ordered Meghana Special Boneless Biryani, which is usually flavorful, but today it lacked the usual spice and punch. The Prawn Ghee Roast was very dry and hard, making it unpleasant to eat. Meghana Chicken 555, another favorite, didn‚Äôt live up to its name either. Only the Lemon Chicken was somewhat okay.",2,09-07-2025,
Marathahalli,Shweta Choudhary,"Extremely disappointed with my recent order from Meghna Foods.<br><br>I had ordered 4 plates of biryani, out of which 3 were Potato Biryani, and shockingly, the potatoes in all 3 plates were mostly raw ‚Äî around 80% were completely uncooked.<br><br>It‚Äôs unacceptable that such a basic and main ingredient was not cooked properly. This ruined the entire meal and reflects very poorly on the quality control and standards of the kitchen.<br><br>I expected much better from Meghna Foods. I am requesting a full refund for the 3 plates of Potato Biryani and hope this issue is taken seriously.",1,20-06-2025,
Marathahalli,Ashutosh Kaushik,"I am rating 1 star so that this comes in light of the Marathahalli Meghana Foods Branch. The food is delicious there is no doubt, the service is fast and good. But what about ambience? The walls need renovation guys it looks so bad that it cant be explained in words photos attached for your reference",1,05-05-2025,
Marathahalli,Akhil Anilkumar,"As a Keralite, I felt the taste of Meghna Biryani was only average.  I felt the price of Rs 375 for a chicken biryani was too high.  Even though the quantity was more than expected, the popularity resulted in a very long wait time, especially at noon. We waited over 20 minutes even at 3:30 PM; imagine the wait from 12 PM to 2 PM.<br><br>The atmosphere and service were quite good. There are three floors, but every seat was occupied up to the third floor.  There is limited parking space.",3,02-05-2025,
Marathahalli,anupama singh,Meghna's Mushroom Biryani is also great. And Lassi is fulfilling. If you sit on 2nd and 3rd floor it's much more comfortable during summer.,5,27-04-2025,1.0
Marathahalli,Sudip Kumar Patel,"It is one of the best places for Hyderabadi biryani in Bangalore.  They taste was just awesome üëå as expected.  We tried 2/3 types of biryani and a chicken starter , and the best taste was the Meghna special biryani. The price was  slightly on the higher side . Parking is also very limited . Service was good.",4,05-04-2025,1.0

Indiranagara,RAHUL RAJ,"Food is too good but biryani option is very less and we used to eat one option only. Meghna needs to add new menu, so people will enjoy more than searching other options.",4,18-08-2025,
Indiranagara,Justin Prasad,"I love the mutton biryani at Meghana ‚Äî I've tried it many times and it's always consistent. The ambience is average, and the wash area is messy and usually crowded, but I still highly recommend it for the quality of the food. Definitely worth a try!",4,14-07-2025,
Indiranagara,Tamim Iqbal,"Absolutely loved it, the quantity might be a bit too much for one person and the biryani I ordered had about 12-15 pieces of chicken and the rice was aromatic and really flavourful. This place is usually very crowded so I would avoid going on weekends.  This was probably the best Biryani I had in Bangalore.",5,29-06-2025,
Indiranagara,Shajinesh Perumbala,Meghna foods is located in the prime location Indiranagar. Valet parking available.food is tasty and hygienic. Well behaved staff. Waiting time is bit high. Their Meghna special Biriyani & Mutton pepper fry is must try items.,4,28-06-2025,
Indiranagara,Vishnu,"Disappointed with the Flavors<br><br>Tried the biriyani and found it quite disappointing ‚Äî overly spicy but lacking real depth or taste. It didn‚Äôt deliver the rich, aromatic flavor you‚Äôd expect from a good biriyani.<br><br>Even more frustrating was the chicken starters ‚Äî we ordered both Pepper Chicken and Lemon Chicken, but they tasted almost identical. No distinct flavor, just the same base with a different name.<br><br>Unfortunately, the overall experience was underwhelming, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it based on this visit.",3,26-06-2025,
Indiranagara,Abdul wahid,"We tried the Meghna Special Boneless Chicken Biriyani , very tasty, flavorful, and served in generous portions. One plate is enough for two people.

Indiranagara,Keerthana Gopalraja,"I am from Chennai and this is the first time I visit this place in Bangalore. I really loved their food and service.

Indiranagara,alexjoyluke,"Excellent service and a great dining experience! We tried several dishes and were impressed overall. The lemon chicken was absolutely delicious and a must-try item. As expected, the biryani was flavorful and satisfying, but the special boneless chicken biryani stood out‚Äîit was even better than the regular ones. We also had kebabs, which were good, though not exceptional. Even the curd rice was tasty and well-prepared. Highly recommend this place for its quality food and top-notch service!",4,07-05-2025,
Indiranagara,Ishita Kulkarni,"Checked out Meghna Biryani and completely understood what the hype is about. I tried the Special chicken biryani and prawns fry for starters. The biryani was delicious, it was filled with spices and was appropriately spicy, the chicken was very tender and tasty. The prawns were fresh and their masala was amazing. The drinks were also quite refreshing. Definitely recommend trying meghna foods if you are in BLR!",5,22-03-2025,
