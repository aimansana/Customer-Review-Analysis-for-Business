Koramangala,Jaber M.,"Meghana Foods is a good, no-frills restaurant. One thing that stands out right away is the hygiene.

Koramangala,saish gaonkar,"Meghana Foods in Koramangala is well-known for its unique biryani presentation, where the flavorful masala (chicken or paneer) is layered on top of the rice. While their chicken biryani is undeniably delicious, the price point makes it a less accessible option for regular biryani cravings. The portion size is certainly adequate. Be prepared for crowds, especially on weekends and holidays during peak hours, as you'll likely encounter a wait.  On a separate occasion, I tried the Chicken 65, which was decent but nothing particularly memorable.

Ashok Nagar,Gaurav Bhatt,"The food was reliably good, as always. We ordered Biryani, Chicken, and Butter Naan. The Biryani maintained its usual quality, the chicken was tasty, but the naan was paper thin. It would be better if the naan was more layered and slightly thicker.<br>Unfortunately, the service did not match the standard of the food. It took five minutes to get mint chutney after our initial request, despite our food being served ten minutes earlier. Additionally, we requested two glasses for a half bottle of Coke, but our request was ignored initially. After reminding the staff, one went to the manager but never returned, leaving us waiting fifteen minutes before another waiter finally provided the glasses.

Ashok Nagar,Sanjeev M,Advice:<br><br>1. Just take 1 biriyani if 2 people are going<br>2. Never order boneless chicken biriyani. The pieces are coated in batter and fried and then put as a gravy on top of the pile of biriyani rice. Very bad. Probably when you order normal biryani it comes with bone and there probably it's not put in a batter and fried.<br>3. It's so sad that chicken 65 is recommended but its not chicken 65 at all. The original is the one from Buhari hotel in Chennai and which is deep fried and red in colour and no batter. This one is again batter and not oil fried but cooked or something.
